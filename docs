Starlet: Starlet manages how your API receives requess and sends back responses.
Pydantic: data validation library(Pydantic is used to check if the data coming into your 
API is correct and in the right format)


Philosophy of FastAPI:
# All API which are made under FastAPI are very fast to run along with fast to code.


Why FastAPU is fast to run:
#                                         (This is nothing but protocol/starlette)
# Web Server                        ----> SGI(translator)                          ----> API Code
                     
POST /predict HTTP/1.1          Request.method --> "POST"                          "prediction":8.3
Host: api.example.com           Request.url    --> "/predict"
Content-Type:application/json   Request.json() --> {"feature1":5.2,"feature2":3.2}   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 45                                                                   Content-Type:       
                                                                                     application/json
                                                                                     {
                                                                                        "prediction":8.3
                                                                                     }
{
    "feature1":5.2,
    "feature2": 3.2
}

# Now request will go from API code to Web server again

Why FastAPI is fast to code:

1: Automatic inpout validation
2: Auto-Generated Interaction Documentation 
3: Seamless integration with modern Ecosystem(ML/DL libraries,OAuth,JWT,
   SQL ALchemey,Docker,Kubernetes etc)
   
# Status code:

They help the client (browswer,mobile app etc) understand

1: whether the request was successful
2: whether something went wrong and what kind of issue occurred(if any)

# 2xx: success : The request was successfully received and processed
# 3xx: Redirect Further action needs to be take (e.g.. redirect)
# 4xx client Error: Something is wrong with the request from client
# 5xx: Server side Error: Something went wrong on the server side
